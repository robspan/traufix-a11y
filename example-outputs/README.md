# Example outputs

This folder contains sample formatter outputs generated by `mat-a11y`.

Why the HTML may look "static" on GitHub
- GitHub's file viewer and the repository file preview intentionally disable or sandbox inline `<script>` execution for security. That means the HTML file will render as static markup in the file view or when you click "View" on GitHub — interactive JavaScript (expand/collapse, filters, keyboard shortcuts) will not run there.

How to view the interactive HTML

- Open locally with a simple static server (recommended):

  ```bash
  # from the repo root
  cd example-outputs
  python -m http.server 8000       # Python 3
  # or
  npx http-server -p 8000          # if you have http-server installed
  ```

  Then open http://localhost:8000/_report-html.html in your browser — scripts will run and the page is interactive.

- Use a raw-to-HTML service (quick preview):

  You can use services like RawGit alternatives (e.g. raw.githack.com) to preview the file as a normal HTML page. Example:

  https://raw.githack.com/robspan/mat-a11y/main/example-outputs/_report-html.html

  (Note: third-party services are convenient but external.)

- Publish via GitHub Pages (best for public interactive demo):

  Move or copy the interactive HTML into a `docs/` folder or use a `gh-pages` branch and enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings. Once published the page is served as a normal website and will be fully interactive.

What I added
- This README: explains why the file looks static on GitHub and gives copy/paste commands to view the interactive HTML locally or publish it.

Next steps (optional)
- I can add a small GitHub Action to publish `example-outputs/_report-html.html` to GitHub Pages automatically (or to a `docs/` folder) after push. Say the word and I'll scaffold it.
